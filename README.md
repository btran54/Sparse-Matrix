Goal:=============================================================================

Our goal in this project is to create a new, and somewhat different integer List ADT, this time in C++. We will use this List to perform shuffling operations, and determine how many shuffles are necessary to bring a List back into its original order

Files:=============================================================================

Matrix.c - Matrix C file containing the operations of Matrix functions.

Matrix.h - Matrix header file containing the forward declarations of functions.

Sparse.c - Sparse file containing the main execution of Matrix.c functions.

MatrixTest.c - Matrix test file containing the testing of operations from Matrix.c

List.c - List file containing the operations of List functions.

List.h - List file containing the forward declarations of functions.

ListTest.c - List test file containing testing of functions from List.c

Makefile - File used to automate build process.
